#not so important info 
- this is my first diary entry logging for coding, I started this way after beginning the project so this log does not start from the beginning of the code 

#Healthtracker_AI 

##Project Goal 

##TechStack 

##Features 

##Tasks 
- get form to calculate and return data 
- fix issues handling bmi (has to calcaute realistic and unrealistic numbers)
- Build AI chatbot  


##Solutions
- allow GET and POST methods for my form 
- take the return bmi, status outside the if,elif,else block

##Bugs 
- Flask route cannot handle HTTP method being used in the request 
- app.py held two routes
- putting return bmi, status inside if,elif,else block meant that if bmi is not in obesity range the function would not return anything and cause Flask to crash/redirect (issue of correct indentation)

##Knowledge gap
- GET and POST http methods 
- Do not know about how to build AI chatbots 

##Overcoming knowledge gap 
- Asked built in copilot to show me how to make AI chatbot and how to install 
- Did not want to blindly copy so I broke down the code in detail for me to understand everything e.g., I woudl write the code first that copilot gave me then I would sit and try understand the code (with my current knowledge) feedback my meaning of the code to copilot and ask if it was correct  << this ensures I am not copying without understandig>>
- Made a list of key questions to hone in my understanding of AI chatbots and the code
- Watched video: "Advanced AI Chatbot in Python - PyTorch Tutorial" Neuraline to consoildiate my understanding
